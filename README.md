This is a portfolio website for the benefit of my game development career in the future.
I plan to expand on this modularly in the future, as I create new things.

Note:
The beginning and structure of this project was built with builder.io, a web based AI application.
It helped do absolute boiler plate structure and code, but started making odd mistakes and not giving me enough control, so I ended up taking the reigns after that.
