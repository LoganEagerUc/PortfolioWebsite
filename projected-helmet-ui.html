        <p class="content-1">This project was created using the <strong>Unity</strong> game engine. It was primarily written in <strong>HLSL</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>, utilising unitys <strong>URP</strong> and <strong>ShaderLabs</strong> API.<br>
          The project was primarily research based and I hit many <i>knowledge</i> blocks, most notably: Matrix transformations, Projection math and 
          other cornerstones of computer graphics like vertex and fragment mapping. Albeit, a great learning experience.

        <h1 class="header-2">Purpose</h1>
        
        <p class="content-1"> I wanted to create a shader which could take a 2D render texture and translate it from the camera onto a concave mesh (as a projector would).<br>
          After watching and completing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjCPr-bxI34">tutorial by RenderBucket</a> for shaders and raymarching. I became fascinated with <strong>shaders</strong> and had found an outlet
          for a retro UI projector, which I had been wanting to do for a long time. I wanted a retro-futuristic feel with an immersive touch for <strong>virtual-reality</strong> based games.

        <h1 class="header-2">Process</h1>
        
        <p class="content-1">I built this project partly during one of my <strong>game computation</strong> university courses, however, after biting off more than I could chew,
          it quickly became a passion project.<br>
          I spent most of my time in old Unity forums and <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>, just trying to get the
          design from my head onto the screen. A small roadblock during development was getting a <i>reactive</i> 2D UI into the projector.<br>
          I ended up solving this by using a 2D render texture, (a common solution for reactive UI's in Unity).

        <h1 class="header-2">Pipeline</h1>

        <p class="content-1">The most difficult problem in this project  was writing the shader. Here is a short explanation of the general pipeline I designed; the players data is handled using <strong>Scriptable Objects</strong>
          this is then handed to the <strong>2D Render Texture</strong> which is finally passed into the shader. In another area --- a script sends all the 
          relevant matrices such as the <strong>Model, View and Projection matrices</strong> from the "Projector Camera" game object, into the shader. The shader than samples the 2D render texture 
          and uses the transformation matrices to take data from the 2D render texture and put it into the target game objects mesh. Its then <i>distorted</i> by a colour and position sin wave animation for aesthetics,
          while also performing a perspective divide to make sure its not orthographic.<br>
          The final product is a 2D texture projected onto a concave target mesh.<br>
