        <p class="content-1">This project was created using the <strong>Unity</strong> game engine. It was primarily written in <strong>HLSL</strong>, utilising unitys <strong>URP</strong> and <strong>ShaderLabs</strong> API.
          the project was primarily research based (atleast for me) and I hit many knowledge blocks, most notably: Matrix transformations, Projection math and 
          other cornerstones of computer graphics like vertex and fragment mapping. Albeit, a great learning experience.

      <section>
        <div><h1 class="header-2">Purpose</h1></div>
        <p class="content-1"> I wanted to create a shader which could take a 2D render texture and translate it from the camera onto a concave mesh (as a projector would). After watching and completing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjCPr-bxI34">tutorial by RenderBucket</a> for shaders and raymarching. I became fascinated with shaders and had found an outlet
          for a retro projector UI which I had been wanting to do for a long time. I wanted a retro-futuristic feel with an immersive touch for virtual reality based games.</p>

      <section>
        <div><h1 class="header-2">Process</h1></div>
        <p class="content-1">I built this partly during one of my game computation university courses, however after biting off more than I could chew,
          it quickly became a passion project. I spent most of my time in old Unity forums and <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>, just trying to get the
           design in my head onto the screen. Notable roadblocks during development were getting a 2D UI into the projector, I ended up solving This
           by using a 2D render texture, (a common solution for reactive UI's in unity)

      <section>
        <div><h1 class="header-2">Product</h1></div>
        <p class="content-1">The most difficult problem in this project byfar was writing the shader, I've attached the git repo below if you would like
          a more complex explanation, but if not here is a short version; the players data is handled using <strong>Scriptable Objects</strong>
           this is then handed to the <strong>2D Render Texture</strong> which is finally passed into the shader. In another area --- a script sends all the 
           relevant matrices such as the <strong>Model, View and Projection matrices</strong> into the shader. The shader than samples the 2D render texture 
           and uses the matrices to transform vertices from the texture into the clip space. Its then <i>distorted</i> by a colour and position sin wave animation 
           while also performing a perspective divide to make sure its not orthographic. The final product is a 2D texture projected onto a concave target mesh. Repo below.
